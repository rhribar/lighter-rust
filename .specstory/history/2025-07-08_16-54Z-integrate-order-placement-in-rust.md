# Integrate order placement in rust (2025-07-08 16:54Z)

_**User**_

hello, i would like to place an order in rust on starknext i have a extended dex which i want to integrate with

i need to sign the order which i send to this api /api/v1/user/order

you should edit test_order.rs

i think first i should do the hash of the payload and then sign it?

check example-api-call.json

flow.txt -> i gathered some a bit of code

@https://github.dev/x10xchange/python_sdk/tree/starknet 

i think you should use starkex and tidy up test_order.rs

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to help integrate with an Extended DEX to place orders on StarkNet. They have a `test_order.rs` file that needs to be edited. Let me analyze the current code and understand what needs to be done.

Looking at the attached `test_order.rs` file, I can see:

1. It's already set up to interact with Extended Exchange API
2. It has functions for signing orders using StarkEx/StarkNet 
3. It has test functions comparing different signature methods
4. The user mentions checking `example-api-call.json` and `flow.txt`
