<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about getting their Hetzner server's IP address to be whitelisted. They want to know:
1. If ifconfig is enough to get the IP
2. If that IP is static
3. If they can just use the IP they connect to via SSH

This is a straightforward infrastructure question about Hetzner VPS/dedicated servers. I should provide clear information about:
- How to get the public IP address
- Whether Hetzner IPs are static by default
- That yes, the IP they SSH to is the one they need for whitelisting

I don't need to use any tools for this - this is general knowledge about Hetzner's infrastructure and IP management.</details></think>

For your Hetzner server, here's what you need to know about getting the IP for whitelisting:

## Getting Your Server's Public IP

**Yes, you can use the IP you SSH to** - that's your server's public IP address that you'll need for whitelisting.

You can verify this in several ways:

1. **Use the SSH IP directly** - `root@some-ip-address` - that IP is your public IP
2. **From the server itself:**
   ```bash
   # Get public IP (recommended)
   curl -4 ifconfig.me
   # or
   curl -4 icanhazip.com
   
   # ifconfig shows network interfaces (may show private IP in some cases)
   ifconfig
   # or
   ip addr show
   ```

## Static IP Status

**Yes, Hetzner IPs are static by default:**
- **Dedicated servers**: Always have static IPs
- **Cloud servers (VPS)**: Have static IPs as long as the server exists
- **Shared vCPU instances**: Also get static IPs

The IP only changes if you:
- Delete and recreate the server
- Explicitly request a new IP
- Switch between different Hetzner products

## For Whitelisting

Use the IP address you SSH to - that's your server's public-facing IP that other services will see when your server makes outbound connections.

You can double-check by running `curl -4 ifconfig.me` from your server to confirm it matches your SSH IP.
