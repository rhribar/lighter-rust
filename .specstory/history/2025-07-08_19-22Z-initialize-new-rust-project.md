_**User**_

please init new rust project

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to initialize a new Rust project. I need to:
1. Create a new Rust project using `cargo init` or `cargo new`
2. This will create the basic structure for a Rust project with Cargo.toml, src/ directory, and main.rs

Let me check the current directory structure first to see what's there, then initialize the Rust project.

Looking at the current project layout, this appears to be a Python project (points-bot) with Python files. The user wants to add a Rust project to this workspace.

I should use `cargo init` to initialize a Rust project in the current directory, or `cargo new` to create a new subdirectory with the Rust project. Since they said "init new rust project", I think they want me to create it in the current workspace.

Let me run `cargo init` to initialize a Rust project in the current directory.</details></think>

I'll initialize a new Rust project in your current workspace. Let me use `cargo init` to set up the basic Rust project structure.

```bash
cargo init --name points-bot
```

```
