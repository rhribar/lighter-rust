i have this issue when installing x10-python-trading

Hello community, just starting and I am having  a small problem from with the lib installation """x10-python-trading""".
I get such an error: ERROR: Failed to build installable wheels for some pyproject.toml based projects (fastecdsa)
anyone stumbled upon the same error?

hey! Ubuntuit's working now, I installed some packages outside of my venv (build-essential libssl-dev python3-dev) and then redone the installation. maybe someone gets this error in the future.
Now I'm decyphering the example code to make a ExtendedUtils class


Python client for Extended API.

Minimum Python version required to use this library is 3.10 (you can use pyenv to manage your Python versions easily).

Installation
pip install x10-python-trading

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about an issue they're having with installing the x10-python-trading library. From the error message, it seems like they're having trouble with the `fastecdsa` package not being able to build wheels. The conversation snippet shows that someone else (AZIZ) had the same issue on Ubuntu and solved it by installing some system packages: `build-essential libssl-dev python3-dev`.

Looking at the SDK documentation from the web search, I can see this is a Python SDK for the x10 exchange that requires Python 3.10+. The SDK</details></think>
